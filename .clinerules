# Project Guidelines

## General Rules

- Rate confidence (1-10) before saving files, after saving, after rejections, and before task completion
- Ask 'stupid' questions like: are you sure this is the best way to implement this?
- Use words like "elegant" and "simple" in prompts

## Documentation Requirements

- Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
- Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
- do not change or update CHANGELOG.md any time, as is automatically created

## Code Style & Patterns

- Use TypeScript axios template
- Place generated code in /src/generated
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use repository pattern for data access

### Code Quality Rules

1. Test Coverage:
   - Before attempting completion, always make sure that any code changes have test coverage
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes

2. Lint Rules:
   - Never disable any lint rules without explicit user approval

3. Styling Guidelines:
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes instead of inline style objects for new markup
   - VSCode CSS variables must be added to webview-ui/src/index.css before using them in Tailwind classes
   - Example: `<div className="text-md text-vscode-descriptionForeground mb-2" />` instead of style objects

## Testing Standards

- Unit tests required for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
