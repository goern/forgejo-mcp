// Helper functions for creating pointers to basic types, primarily for use in
// constructing jsonschema.Schema objects where optional fields require pointers.

// BoolPtr creates a pointer to a bool value.
// This is useful for setting optional boolean fields in structs that will be
// serialized to JSON, such as in MCP tool definitions.
func BoolPtr(b bool) *bool {
	return &b
}

// IntPtr creates a pointer to an int value.
// This is useful for setting optional integer fields in structs that will be
// serialized to JSON, such as in MCP tool definitions.
func IntPtr(i int) *int {
	return &i
}

// Float64Ptr creates a pointer to a float64 value.
// This is useful for setting optional number fields in structs that will be
// serialized to JSON, such as in MCP tool definitions.
func Float64Ptr(f float64) *float64 {
	return &f
