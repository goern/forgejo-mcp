# Bug Report: Missing Test Coverage in Core Services

## Description

Several critical service methods lack test coverage, which could lead to undiscovered bugs in production. Additionally, some edge cases in error handling and logging are not fully tested.

## Status

✅ Partially Fixed - CodebergService test coverage has been improved

## Severity

Medium - While the core functionality is tested, missing coverage could hide potential issues.

## Areas Affected

1. ✅ CodebergService (Fixed)
2. ErrorHandler
3. Logger

## Specific Issues

### CodebergService

1. ✅ Added test coverage for:
   - updateIssue method (success, validation, API errors)
   - getRepository method (success, validation, not found)
   - listIssues method (success with filters, empty results, validation, API errors)
2. ✅ Improved error handling and retry logic coverage
3. ✅ Added edge cases for API responses

### ErrorHandler (Still Pending)

1. Edge cases for complex error scenarios not fully tested
2. Limited testing of error chaining and context preservation

### Logger (Still Pending)

1. Missing tests for custom error type formatting
2. Limited testing of complex nested context objects

## Steps to Reproduce

N/A - This is a code quality issue related to test coverage.

## Expected Behavior

All service methods should have comprehensive test coverage including:

- Happy path scenarios
- Error cases
- Edge cases
- Retry logic verification
- Input validation
- Response mapping

## Current Behavior

CodebergService now has comprehensive test coverage. ErrorHandler and Logger services still need additional test coverage for edge cases and complex scenarios.

## Remaining Work

### ErrorHandler Tests

1. Add edge case tests:

```typescript
describe("error handling edge cases", () => {
  // Test nested errors
  // Test circular references
  // Test custom error types
  // Test error context preservation
});
```

### Logger Tests

1. Add custom error type tests:

```typescript
describe("custom error logging", () => {
  // Test domain-specific errors
  // Test error inheritance chain
  // Test complex error contexts
});
```

## Additional Context

- CodebergService test coverage has been significantly improved
- Remaining work focuses on edge cases in ErrorHandler and Logger services
- All core functionality now has test coverage
