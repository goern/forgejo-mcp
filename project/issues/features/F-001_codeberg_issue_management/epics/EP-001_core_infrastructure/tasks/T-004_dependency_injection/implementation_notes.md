# Implementation Notes: T-004 Dependency Injection

## Overview

Implemented dependency injection using InversifyJS to improve modularity, testability, and maintainability of the codebase. The implementation follows the architecture design from T-002 and integrates with the existing services from T-003.

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Container Configuration

- Created `src/container.ts` to centralize DI configuration
- Defined type symbols for all injectable dependencies
- Implemented container factory functions for both production and testing
- Added proper singleton scoping for services

### 2. Service Updates

#### CodebergService

- Added `@injectable()` decorator
- Updated constructor with `@inject()` decorators
- Properly typed all dependencies
- Maintained existing functionality while adding DI support

#### ErrorHandler

- Added `@injectable()` decorator
- Kept stateless design for better testing
- Maintained error handling and retry logic

#### Logger

- Added `@injectable()` decorator
- Implemented service name injection
- Maintained structured logging capabilities

### 3. Type Management

- Properly separated type imports using `type` keyword
- Maintained value imports for error classes
- Updated tsconfig.json to support decorators:

  ```json
  {
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
  }
  ```

### 4. Testing Support

- Created test container factory
- Added mock configuration for testing
- Maintained ability to override services for tests

## Technical Decisions

1. **Singleton Scope**: Used singleton scope for services to ensure consistent state and resource management.

2. **Configuration Injection**: Implemented configuration injection through the container to make it easier to switch configurations between environments.

3. **Type Separation**: Carefully separated type and value imports to work with TypeScript's `isolatedModules` and `emitDecoratorMetadata` settings.

## Dependencies

- inversify: ^6.0.0
- reflect-metadata: ^0.2.0

## Testing Considerations

- Container setup can be tested independently
- Services can be easily mocked for unit tests
- Test container provides consistent test environment

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Create and configure container
const container = createContainer({
  baseUrl: "https://codeberg.org/api/v1",
  token: process.env.CODEBERG_TOKEN,
  timeout: 5000,
  maxRetries: 3,
});

// Resolve service
const codebergService = container.get<ICodebergService>(TYPES.CodebergService);
```

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding middleware support for cross-cutting concerns
2. Add more granular scoping options if needed
3. Consider implementing factory patterns for complex object creation

## Related Changes

- Updated tsconfig.json for decorator support
- Added new dependencies to package.json
- Updated service implementations with DI decorators

## Testing Strategy

1. Container Tests:

   - Verify service resolution
   - Test singleton behavior
   - Validate configuration injection

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify services work together
   - Test error handling
   - Validate logging

## Notes

- All acceptance criteria have been met
- Implementation follows SOLID principles
- Services maintain their original contracts
- Added proper type safety throughout
