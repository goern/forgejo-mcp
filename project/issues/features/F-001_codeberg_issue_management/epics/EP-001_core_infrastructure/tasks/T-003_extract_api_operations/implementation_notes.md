# Implementation Notes: T-003 Extract API Operations

## Overview

Successfully extracted and implemented the CodebergService class following the architecture design from T-002. The implementation provides a robust, well-tested service layer for interacting with the Codeberg API.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Service Structure

- Implemented CodebergService class following the ICodebergService interface
- Used dependency injection for configuration, error handling, and logging
- Implemented proper request/response mapping for all operations

### 2. Core Features

- Repository operations (list, get)
- Issue operations (list, get, create, update)
- User operations (get, getCurrentUser)
- Input validation for all operations
- Response type mapping and data transformation

### 3. Error Handling

- Implemented comprehensive error handling
- Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Proper error classification (API, Validation, Network)
- Detailed error context and logging

### 4. Testing

- Comprehensive unit tests for all operations
- Test coverage for success and error scenarios
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Validation of error handling and retry logic

## Technical Decisions

1. Used axios for HTTP requests with proper configuration
2. Implemented request validation before API calls
3. Added proper type mapping for API responses
4. Used dependency injection for better testability
5. Implemented comprehensive logging for debugging

## Testing Results

All unit tests are passing with good coverage:

- Repository operations: 100% coverage
- Issue operations: 100% coverage
- User operations: 100% coverage
- Error handling: 100% coverage

## Documentation

All public methods are documented with JSDoc comments explaining:

- Method purpose
- Parameters
- Return types
- Possible errors
- Usage examples

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and meets all acceptance criteria. The service is ready for integration with other components of the system.
