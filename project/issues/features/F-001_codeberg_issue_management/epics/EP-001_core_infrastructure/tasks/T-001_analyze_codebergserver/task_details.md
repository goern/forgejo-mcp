# Task: T-001_analyze_codebergserver

## Overview

Analyze the current CodebergServer implementation to identify areas for refactoring and improvement.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document current CodebergServer class structure and responsibilities
- [ ] Identify API operation patterns that can be extracted
- [ ] List all error handling mechanisms currently in place
- [ ] Document current authentication and token handling flow
- [ ] Identify areas where dependency injection can be introduced
- [ ] Create a report of technical debt and improvement opportunities
- [ ] Propose initial service boundaries for refactoring

## Technical Details

### Analysis Areas

1. Class Structure

   - Review class methods and properties
   - Identify cohesive functionality groups
   - Document class dependencies

2. API Operations

   - List all Codeberg API endpoints used
   - Document request/response patterns
   - Identify common operation patterns

3. Error Handling

   - Document error types and handling strategies
   - Review error propagation paths
   - Identify areas needing improved error handling

4. Authentication Flow
   - Document token management
   - Review security measures
   - Identify potential security improvements

### Required Skills

- TypeScript expertise
- Understanding of SOLID principles
- Experience with API design patterns
- Knowledge of dependency injection patterns

### Development Notes
