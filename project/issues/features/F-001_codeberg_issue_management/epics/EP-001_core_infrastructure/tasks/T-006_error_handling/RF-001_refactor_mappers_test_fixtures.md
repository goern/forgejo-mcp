# Task Log: RF-001_refactor_mappers_test_fixtures - Code Refactoring

**Goal:** Refactor `src/services/utils/__tests__/mappers.test.ts` to extract inline test data into reusable fixtures for clarity and maintainability.

---

## Analysis of `mappers.test.ts`

Identified inline test data candidates for extraction:

- **Valid repository data** (lines 10-28)
- **Repository data missing owner** (lines 45-55)
- **Valid user data** (lines 66-73)

---

## Refactoring Plan

1. **Create fixtures file**

   Created `src/services/utils/__tests__/fixtures/mappers.fixtures.ts` with exported fixtures:

   - `validRepoData`
   - `repoDataMissingOwner`
   - `validUserData`

2. **Refactor tests**

   Updated `mappers.test.ts` to import and use these fixtures.

3. **Verification**

   Ran `npm test`. Result:

   - `src/services/utils/__tests__/mappers.test.ts` **passed** successfully after refactoring.
   - 1 unrelated test suite (`issue.service.test.ts`) failed, unrelated to this change.

---

## Status: âœ… Complete

**Outcome:** Success

**Summary:** Extracted inline test data from `mappers.test.ts` into dedicated fixtures file. Tests using these fixtures pass, improving clarity and maintainability.

- [`src/services/utils/__tests__/fixtures/mappers.fixtures.ts` (new)]
