# Implementation Notes: Enhanced getIssue Command

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Metadata Support**

   - Added milestone data fetching and mapping
   - Improved error handling for metadata fetches
   - Added proper type validation for cached data

2. **Improved Caching**

   - Added state-based TTL (Time To Live):
     - Closed issues: 1 hour cache
     - Open issues: 5 minutes cache
   - Added cache validation using isIssue type guard
   - Auto-invalidation of invalid cached data

3. **Error Handling**

   - Added proper error handling for API calls
   - Graceful handling of metadata fetch failures
   - Improved error logging with context

4. **Validation Rules**
   - Added basic validation rules for issue title:
     - Required field validation
     - Maximum length validation (255 characters)
   - Rules are added to each issue instance

## Testing

1. **New Test Cases Added**

   - Full metadata fetching including milestone
   - Cache validation and invalidation
   - State-based TTL verification
   - Error handling for metadata fetches
   - Validation rules presence

2. **Test Coverage**
   - All new functionality is covered by tests
   - Existing tests continue to pass
   - Edge cases and error scenarios tested

## Technical Decisions

1. Made milestone fetching part of metadata to keep backward compatibility
2. Used Promise.all for parallel metadata fetches to improve performance
3. Implemented individual error handling for each metadata fetch to prevent total failure
4. Added type validation for cached data to prevent invalid data usage

## Next Steps

1. Implement updateTitle command (T-016)
2. Add comprehensive unit tests (T-019)
