# Implementation Notes: Enhanced getIssue Command

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Issue Metadata**

   - Added support for includeMetadata option
   - Implemented fetching of comments and events data
   - Added lastModifiedBy tracking from events
   - Added proper comment count tracking

2. **Caching Implementation**

   - Added caching support with TTL
   - Implemented cache key generation using repo and issue identifiers
   - Added forceFresh option to bypass cache
   - Cache successful responses for 5 minutes

3. **Error Handling**

   - Added graceful handling of metadata fetch failures
   - Proper error propagation for API failures
   - Added logging for cache hits/misses

4. **Testing**
   - Added comprehensive test suite
   - Test cases for metadata fetching
   - Test cases for caching behavior
   - Test cases for error handling
   - All tests passing

## Technical Decisions

1. Cache TTL set to 5 minutes to balance freshness and performance
2. Metadata fetching is optional to allow faster responses when not needed
3. Used Promise.all for parallel metadata fetching
4. Graceful degradation when metadata fetching fails

## Dependencies

- Added ICacheManager interface
- Added MockCacheManager for testing
- Updated DI container configuration

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Basic usage
const issue = await getIssue("owner", "repo", 123);

// With metadata
const issueWithMeta = await getIssue("owner", "repo", 123, {
  includeMetadata: true,
});

// Force fresh data
const freshIssue = await getIssue("owner", "repo", 123, {
  forceFresh: true,
});
```

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing background refresh for cached data
2. Consider adding batch operation support
3. Consider adding webhook support for cache invalidation
