## Parent Epic

EP-002_issue_management

## Description

Analyze the existing issue management code to identify current capabilities, limitations, and areas for enhancement. This analysis will inform the implementation of new features and improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document current issue management code structure and flow
- [ ] Identify all existing issue-related API calls and their usage
- [ ] List current limitations and potential improvement areas
- [ ] Document dependencies on core infrastructure
- [ ] Create a technical recommendations document for implementation

## Technical Details

Areas to analyze:

- Current issue data model and type definitions
- Existing API integration points
- Error handling mechanisms
- State management approach
- Current validation logic
- Test coverage

Focus on:

- How the current code interacts with Codeberg's API
- Where the new functionality will fit in
- Potential reusable components
- Integration points with EP-001 core infrastructure

## Dependencies
