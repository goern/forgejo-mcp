# Feature: F-001_codeberg_issue_management

## Overview

**Feature Name:** Codeberg Issue Management
**Priority Level:** High
**Status:** Draft

## Business Value

This feature will enable users to efficiently manage Codeberg issues directly through MCP tools, improving workflow integration and productivity for development teams using Codeberg for issue tracking.

## Job Stories

1. When I need to update an issue's description, I want to use an MCP tool command so I can make changes without leaving my development environment.
2. When I need to modify an issue's title, I want to use an MCP tool command so I can quickly update it without context switching.
3. When I need to manage issue labels, I want to use MCP tool commands to add or remove labels so I can efficiently organize and categorize issues.
4. When I need to review task progress, I want to query an issue's todo list so I can quickly see what items are completed and pending.
5. When I complete a task, I want to toggle a specific todo item's status so I can track progress directly from my development environment.

## Functional Requirements

### Issue Description Management

- Users must be able to update the description of an existing Codeberg issue
- The tool must preserve existing issue metadata when updating descriptions
- Users must be able to view the current description before making changes

### Issue Title Management

- Users must be able to update the title of an existing Codeberg issue
- The tool must maintain all other issue attributes when updating the title
- Users must be able to view the current title before making changes

### Label Management

- Users must be able to add one or more labels to an issue
- Users must be able to remove one or more labels from an issue
- Users must be able to view current labels on an issue
- The tool must validate label names against available repository labels

### Todo Management

- Users must be able to list all todo items from an issue's description
- Users must be able to see the status (checked/unchecked) of each todo item
- Users must be able to toggle the status of specific todo items
- The tool must preserve the original formatting and content of the issue description when updating todos
- The tool must handle markdown checkbox syntax ([ ] and [x]) correctly

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Commands should complete within 2 seconds under normal network conditions
- The tool should handle network timeouts gracefully

### Security

- The tool must use secure authentication with Codeberg API
- User credentials must be stored securely
- API tokens must be used instead of username/password authentication

### Usability

- Commands should follow consistent naming patterns
- Each command should provide clear feedback on success or failure
- Help documentation should be available for all commands

## Acceptance Criteria

### Issue Description Updates

- [ ] Successfully update an issue description using the MCP tool
- [ ] Verify the update is reflected immediately on Codeberg
- [ ] Confirm all other issue attributes remain unchanged
- [ ] Verify proper error handling for invalid issue IDs

### Title Updates

- [ ] Successfully update an issue title using the MCP tool
- [ ] Verify the update is reflected immediately on Codeberg
- [ ] Confirm all other issue attributes remain unchanged
- [ ] Verify proper error handling for invalid issue IDs

### Label Management

- [ ] Successfully add a single label to an issue
- [ ] Successfully add multiple labels to an issue
- [ ] Successfully remove a single label from an issue
- [ ] Successfully remove multiple labels from an issue
- [ ] Verify proper error handling for non-existent labels
- [ ] Confirm label changes are reflected immediately on Codeberg

### Todo Management

- [ ] Successfully retrieve a list of todos from an issue
- [ ] Display todo items with their current status (checked/unchecked)
- [ ] Successfully toggle the status of a specific todo item
- [ ] Verify todo status changes are reflected immediately on Codeberg
- [ ] Confirm the rest of the issue description remains unchanged when updating todos
- [ ] Verify proper error handling for invalid todo indices

## Dependencies

- Codeberg API access
- Authentication mechanism for Codeberg API
- Existing MCP tool infrastructure

## Implementation Notes

- Will require integration with Codeberg's REST API
- May need to implement caching for label lists
- Should consider rate limiting requirements of Codeberg API
- Will need to implement markdown parsing for todo detection and manipulation
- Should consider implementing local caching of todo lists for better performance

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                | Mitigation                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| API rate limiting   | Implement proper caching and request throttling        |
| Network failures    | Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff    |
| Invalid credentials | Provide clear error messages and credential validation |

## Future Considerations

- Potential expansion to support other issue management features (comments, status changes)
- Integration with local git workflow
- Batch operations for managing multiple issues
